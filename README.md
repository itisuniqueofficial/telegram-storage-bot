## Usage

### Upload File

* Send any file to the bot.
* The bot will save it, generate a unique File ID and reply with a deep link.

### Retrieve File

* Use the deep link:

```
https://t.me/<your_bot_username>?start=<FileID>
```

### Commands

* `/start` ‚Äî Start interaction or retrieve file by deep link.
* `/help` ‚Äî Show usage instructions.
* `/stats` ‚Äî Show session stats.
* `/announce` ‚Äî Admin-only: broadcast message (reply to a message).

---

## Announcement System

* Admin can reply to any message with `/announce`.
* The bot will send that message to all users listed in `users.txt`.
* Supports text, photo, video, audio, documents, voice, and video notes.

---

## File Storage Logic

* Files are forwarded and stored inside your specified Telegram group.
* The File ID is simply a combination of timestamp, user ID, and message ID.

---

## File Structure

```
users.txt ‚Äî All unique user IDs are stored here.
bot.py ‚Äî Main bot script.
```

---

## Security Notice

* The bot doesn‚Äôt store actual files locally.
* Telegram handles the physical file storage inside your group.
* File ID only maps to Telegram group forwarded message IDs.
